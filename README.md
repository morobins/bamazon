This is a command line app that allows for functionality for three different users, the customer, the manager and the supervisor.

Through a **MySQL database** that is kept, the customer can access the items available and select a quantity to purchase.

The **Manager** has the largest functionality - the ability to check the stock, see specifically which items have low stock, add stock to existing items or add new products.

The **Supervisor** can add new departments and will eventually be able to pull a report (still a work in progress) to see total department overhead, sales and profits.
